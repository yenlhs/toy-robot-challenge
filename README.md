# Magentus Coding Challenge: Toy Robot Simulator

## Description

The task is to create a simulation of a toy robot moving on a square tabletop of dimensions 5 units x 5 units.

- There are no obstructions on the table surface.
- The robot is free to move around the surface, but must not fall off the table.
- Any movement that would cause the robot to fall must be ignored, while valid commands should still be accepted and executed.

## Application Requirements

Your application must be able to read and process the following commands:

- PLACE X,Y,F
- MOVE
- LEFT
- RIGHT
- REPORT

## Command Details

### PLACE X,Y,F

- Places the robot on the table at coordinates (X, Y), facing direction F (NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, or WEST).
- The origin (0,0) represents the south-west corner of the table.
- The first valid command must be a PLACE command.
- Any commands before a valid PLACE should be ignored.
- Additional PLACE commands can be used to reposition the robot.

### MOVE

- Moves the robot one unit forward in the direction it is currently facing.

### LEFT / RIGHT

- Rotates the robot 90° in the specified direction without changing its position.

### REPORT

- Outputs the current X, Y, and F (facing direction) of the robot.
- Output format is flexible, but standard console output is sufficient.

## Constraints

- The robot must not fall off the table.
- Any move that would result in the robot falling should be ignored.
- A robot not yet placed on the table should ignore all commands except PLACE.
- Input may be provided via file or standard input, at your discretion.
- Please include test data to demonstrate your solution.

## Example Input and Output

### Example A

```
PLACE 0,0,NORTH
MOVE
REPORT
```

**Output:** `0,1,NORTH`

### Example B

```
PLACE 0,0,NORTH
LEFT
REPORT
```

**Output:** `0,0,WEST`

### Example C

```
PLACE 1,2,EAST
MOVE
MOVE
LEFT
MOVE
REPORT
```

**Output:** `3,3,NORTH`

## How to run the app

In terminal run the following command

```
node index <path/file.txt>
```

e.g node index sample/exampleA.txt
